# SharedDriveFilesCommentsOrSuggestions

If you use Google Shared Drives and use the comment or suggested edit features, then you may want to know what files have open comments or suggested edits, but unfortunately Google doesn't offer any way to do this other than opening every file... This script demonstrates how to send an HTML formatted email with links to any Google documents in the shared drives specified that have open comments or suggested edits.

The scripts require that one enable the services Docs and Drive.
